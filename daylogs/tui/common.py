"""Behaviour shared by the two tabs that draw width-sensitive panels.

Both concerns here are the same concern — a panel's contents are built to its own
measured width, so they have to be rebuilt when that width changes — and both were
written twice (three times for the width probe, with three different floor values
and the same magic fallback).

Kept to exactly that. `focus_default`, the cursor-bounds check and the prompt
dispatch chain are also near-identical between the tabs, and are deliberately
*not* here: they are one or two lines each, and a one-line override that you can
read in place beats an inherited one you have to go and find.

        never fires — each tab has to ask for its own redraw.

        Only on a **width** change, which is the whole reason this handler exists: a
        panel's contents are built to its own measured width. Height rebuilds nothing,
        and rebuilding anyway is not merely wasted work — `reload` calls `_fill_table`,
        which does `table.clear(columns=True)`, so the DataTable cursor goes back to row
        0. Everything in the bottom container changes the tab's height by appearing:
        opening any prompt did it (documented as pre-existing, and it is this), and so
        does the in-progress popup, which is how a photo estimate started throwing away
        the food row you had selected.

        A width alone is not enough to latch on, though, and the first version of this
        guard was wrong for exactly that reason. `show_scope` reloads the tab it just
        switched to *before* that pane is laid out, so `panel_width` measures 0 and takes
        the 46-column `_FALLBACK`; the Resize that would correct it then arrives at the
        same *tab* width and was dropped, so the guessed build stuck. From the second
        visit onward every chart and bar drew at 46 columns inside a 96-column panel and
        only healed on the next key that happened to reload. `refresh_tabs()` — `u`, `h`,
        `n` — has the same shape for the two tabs that are not on screen. So a build that
        had to guess is never treated as settled.

        Known, separate, and older than this guard: the reload happens *during* the
        resize, when a panel's `content_size` still holds the previous layout's width. So
        the contents are built to the width the panel is about to stop having — dragging
        120 columns to 80 measured a 76-column panel and drew a 36-column chart in it,
        until the next keypress reloaded the tab. `call_after_refresh(self.reload)` fixes
        it in a hand-run app and could not be made to fail-then-pass reliably in the test
        harness, so it is written down here rather than shipped on a coin flip.
