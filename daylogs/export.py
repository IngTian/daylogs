"""Your data, in files anything can read.

`day backup` writes a copy only daylogs can open. That is the right tool for
losing your laptop and the wrong one for looking at three years of spend in a
spreadsheet, so this writes one CSV per table instead.

CSV rather than JSON because every one of the six tables is flat scalars, so
JSON's type fidelity would buy almost nothing, while "double-click it" is the
most likely thing anyone actually does with an export. The one real cost is that
CSV cannot tell NULL from an empty string — a note that was never written and a
note that was written empty come out the same. Documented rather than worked
around, because inventing a sentinel would be worse.

One file per table, mirroring the schema, rather than a denormalised sheet per
subject: weight and food have different grains — one reading against several
meals a day — so joining them would be a reporting decision this module has no
business making. The daily summary is where the human-readable job is done.

Not an importer. Round-tripping an export back in raises real conflict questions
and the one-shot importer this project already retired is the cautionary tale.
