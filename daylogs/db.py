"""SQLite connection + schema. Seven tables, one idempotent DDL block.

No migration framework: the DDL is CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS throughout, so adding
a table is additive on an existing database. The version is stamped in
PRAGMA user_version so a future change has somewhere to hook.

journal_mode=DELETE is deliberate. WAL's -wal/-shm sidecars can sync
independently of the main file under iCloud Drive and corrupt the database on
the receiving device. daylogs is read-heavy; the write cost is noise.
