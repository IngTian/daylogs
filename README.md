# daylogs

I only get real control of my weight and my spending when I type the numbers in
myself — not when something syncs them for me, but when I deliberately type them.
The typing is what makes me notice, and noticing is what changes the next
decision. A number that arrives on its own gets read once and forgotten.

So daylogs has no bank integration and no health-app import, deliberately. The
manual entry isn't friction waiting to be automated away; it is the mechanism.
Everything here exists to make that daily typing fast enough that I keep doing
it — a grammar that takes a whole entry on one line, and one keystroke per view.

Three things, in a terminal: what you weigh, what you eat, and what you spend —
plus one short daily read of all of it, written by Claude.

One command. One process. No server, no browser, no ports.

## What it is, and what it isn't

Three things, deliberately. There is no income tracking, no net worth, no cash
projection, no investments, no journal, no sync, no server and no web UI. Money
answers one question: where did it go this period, and am I inside the budget.

The design rule: **anything that doesn't survive daily use doesn't ship.**

## Install

```bash
uv tool install daylogs
```

or, equivalently, `pipx install daylogs`. Either one puts `day` on your `PATH` in
its own isolated environment — no environment to activate, nothing added to
whatever Python you use for other work. If you have neither tool, `uv` installs in
one line:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Upgrade with `uv tool upgrade daylogs`, remove with `uv tool uninstall daylogs`.
To run an unreleased `main` instead of the published version:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/IngTian/daylogs
```

Working on daylogs itself is a different setup — see [Development](#development).

**Requirements.** Python 3.12+ and any terminal with truecolour. macOS and Linux;
not tested on Windows.

The [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.com/claude-code) on `PATH` is needed for
calorie estimation and the daily summary — everything else works without it, and
the app degrades to plain messages rather than failing.

Pasting a photo from the clipboard uses `osascript`, so that one path is macOS
only. The inbox folder and a pasted file path work anywhere.

## Use

```bash
day                            # the TUI
day summary                    # generate yesterday's summary, print to stdout
day summary --date 2026-08-20  # a specific day
day backup ~/Drive/daylogs     # consistent DB copy (cron-friendly)
day export ~/Drive/daylogs     # one CSV per table, readable anywhere
day --version
```

`uv tool install` already puts `day` on your `PATH`, so there is no environment to
activate. If you installed into an environment by hand instead, symlink the
console script:

```bash
ln -sf "$(command -v day)" ~/.local/bin/day
```

`build_binary.sh` produces a standalone PyInstaller executable for a machine with
no Python at all — but it starts in ~4,770 ms against ~60 ms for an installed
console script, because `--onefile` unpacks 15 MB on every launch. Prefer a real
install unless you genuinely have no Python.

### Keys

Press `?` for the full map at any time — it's generated from the same table the
bindings and the footer come from, so it can't be out of date.

The footer is two rows: what you're looking at on top (range, sort, filters), and
the keys below, grouped into actions, view controls and navigation and coloured by
group. On a narrow terminal it sheds navigation keys first and never `?` or `q`.

**Everywhere**

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `1` `2` `3` | Day / Body / Money |
| `←` `→` | previous / next tab — stops at the ends rather than wrapping |
| `tab` `shift+tab` | next / previous sub-view *within* the tab — the strip above the table lists them and marks the one you're on (Body, Money) |
| `[` `]` | previous / next period — report on Day, day on Body, month on Money |
| `t` | **jump to now** — today, this month, newest report |
| `g` | go to a date (`2026-06-15` or `2026-06`) |
| `+` or `=` | zoom **in** — a shorter time horizon, seen in more detail (Body, Money) |
| `-` | zoom **out** — a longer horizon: `1d` `3d` `1w` `1m` `MTD` `3m` `YTD` `1y` `all` |
| `T` | change the theme — `tab` completes the list, and the choice is remembered |
| `?` | the full keymap |
| `u` | undo the last delete or edit |
| `esc` | back out one step — never quits |
| `q` | quit |

`t` and `g` are why `[` / `]` stepping one period at a time is fine: you're
never more than two keystrokes from anywhere.

**Day — `1`** · `r` regenerates the daily read. `[` `]` browse earlier ones; the
figures above them are always today's.

**Body — `2`**

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `w` | weigh in |
| `f` | log food |
| `p` | log food from a photo |
| `a` | log an activity — only for a day that departs from your ordinary one |
| `c` | cycle the chart: weight → intake → net |
| `h` | set height, sex, birthday and your ordinary-day level (for BMR, maintenance and BMI) |
| `enter` | edit the selected row |
| `x` | delete the selected row (confirm with `y`) |

**Money — `3`**

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `e` | log an expense |
| `b` | set a budget line |
| `s` | add or update a recurring item |
| `r` | roll active recurring items into the month's budget |
| `d` `c` `k` | sort by date / cost / category — press again to flip direction |
| `/` | filter by text |
| `G` | group the expense list by category |
| `enter` | drill into a category, fold a group, or edit the selected row |
| `x` | delete the selected row (confirm with `y`) |

### What you type

| Prompt | Type | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `weigh ›` | `78.2` | logged now |
| `weigh ›` | `78.2 post-run @07:30` | with a note, at a time |
| `food ›` | `chicken salad =610` | labelled — no LLM call |
| `food ›` | `chicken salad` | Claude estimates; review and accept |
| `activity ›` | `gym 1h =active` | the whole day was an `active` day — no LLM call |
| `activity ›` | `gym 1h =1.45` | the same, as a multiplier |
| `activity ›` | `gym 1h` | Claude estimates the day's factor; review and accept |
| `expense ›` | `12.40 lunch !restaurant` | amount, description, category |
| `expense ›` | `127 Grocery Item X !grocery ~receipt in wallet` | with a note |
| `expense ›` | `-24.99 returned shoes !grocery` | a refund |
| `budget ›` | `500 !grocery` | named after the category |
| `recurring ›` | `20.99 Streaming !subscriptions #monthly` | monthly |

Sigils mark the fields, so nothing is ever taken out of your own words:

    !  a category                   tab completes
    #  a cycle                      tab completes
    @  a date and/or a time         @2026-08-24  @08-24  @14:30  @08-24/14:30
    ~  a note (may contain spaces)
    =  calories

Everything unsigiled is the description. The first token is the amount. `\` escapes
a leading sigil, so `\!important` is just a word.

Every prompt shows what it wants, in three places and no extra screen rows:

```
╭─ profile › ───────────────────────────────────────╮
│ 180 male 1990-01-01                               │   the example, greyed
╰─ height · m/f · birthday — any order, partial ok ─╯   the grammar, persistent
```

The example is the placeholder, so it gets out of the way as soon as you type. The
grammar stays, because that's the part you still want halfway through a line. Every
example is a line the parser actually accepts — a test parses all of them.

Every write answers with its consequence, not just an acknowledgement —
`78.2 kg logged · ▼0.4 vs 7d`, or `12.40 lunch → restaurant 289.50 of 200.00 ⚠`.

A rejected entry **keeps your text** and shows why on the bottom border, so one
wrong character costs one correction rather than a retype.

Amounts take `$` and thousands separators (`$1,240.50`), but a comma is never a
decimal point — `12,40` is rejected with a suggestion rather than quietly becoming
1240.

### Editing

`enter` acts on whatever is under the cursor: a weight, food, expense or recurring
row opens for editing, a category drills in, a group folds.

Editing prefills the same grammar you used for entry. The submitted line is
authoritative: drop the note words and the note is cleared; submit unchanged and
the note survives. Food entries always require `=kcal` — dropping it is rejected
rather than silently zeroing the calories. Each line carries exactly the columns
that row's table shows, so what you can see is what you can edit.

`u` undoes an edit as well as a delete.

### Time horizons

One list serves both tabs, so `+` and `-` mean the same thing everywhere:

    1d · 3d · 1w · 1m · MTD · 3m · YTD · 1y · all

`1d`/`3d`/`1w`/`1m`/`3m`/`1y` look back from the day you're on; `MTD` and `YTD` run
from the start of that month or year. `[` and `]` then step by one whole horizon — on
`MTD` that's a calendar month, so you compare the same elapsed slice of the previous
month rather than a ragged window.

**At `1d` and `3d` the weight chart switches to a clock.** The axis is labelled in
hours instead of dates, and every weigh-in is plotted at the time it was taken —
so two readings on one day sit apart rather than on top of each other. Wider
horizons keep one point per day, deliberately: weight swings a kilo inside a day,
and plotting every reading across a month makes the trend noisier without telling
you anything a shorter window wouldn't tell you better.

The horizon drives the whole Body tab, not just the chart: the **weight** table lists
the weigh-ins inside the window and its header names it, so `+` / `-` / `[` / `]` move
the table and the plot together. The **food** and **activity** tables are per-day —
they follow the day you're on rather than the window, because a day's meals are a day's
meals.

`g 2026-06` lands on the **last** day of June, so under `MTD` you get all of it.

### Reading money

Over several months the budget column is the **sum** of those months' lines.

Green means inside the budget, amber means within 10% of a cap, red means over —
alongside the `⚠` glyph, never instead of it. On Body, a falling weight is green and
a rising one red; there's no goal weight to compare against, so that's an
assumption, and the arrow carries the direction either way.

`T` changes the **theme** — the background, borders, muted text and accents. Every
theme Textual ships is on offer (gruvbox, nord, tokyo-night, dracula, catppuccin,
solarized, rose-pine and a dozen more); `tab` completes the names, and the choice is
written to `config.toml` so it survives a restart. daylogs defines no palettes of
its own: the stylesheet uses only Textual's design tokens, so this costs nothing to
maintain.

What a theme deliberately does **not** change is the nine category colours or the
green/red/amber signals. A category's colour is its identity — grocery being amber
is a fact about grocery, not about the chrome around it — and those hues were
checked against a warm dark theme, a cool dark theme and a light one.

The Day tab speaks the same three colours rather than inventing any: the weight
trend and the calorie net are green down and red up, on that same assumption; what
is left of the budget is green while positive and red once over; and the burn line
turns amber when spending has run **ahead of the elapsed days**, not past a flat
threshold — 84% on day 27 of 31 is fine and the same number on day 12 is not. Every
sign and glyph stays, so colour is emphasis rather than the only signal.

A month nobody has rolled yet has no budget at all, and the header says so and
names the key rather than reporting a meaningless "0.00 budget".

The burn bar's `┃` marker is how far through the month you are — 84% of budget
spent on day 27 of 31 is fine, the same number on day 12 is not. It only appears
for the current single month, because burn-against-elapsed means nothing across a
quarter; the bar says so when it's hidden.

### Panels

**Day** shows BODY beside MONEY — today's weight, BMI and trend, intake against
what the day cost, this month's spend against its budget and how far through the
month you are — with the generated daily read scrolling underneath. The figures are
always today's; the read is dated by the day it describes, which is why each half
carries its own date.

**Body** shows TREND (the braille chart) beside ENERGY — intake against
maintenance for the day, then the average and a sparkline over the horizon.

![The Body tab: the braille weight chart beside the day's energy balance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IngTian/daylogs/main/assets/body.png)

**Money** shows BUDGET vs SPENT beside WHERE IT WENT. The first scales each bar to
that category's own cap, so "how close to this limit" is readable per row; the
second is a ranked share list.

![The Money tab: budget-versus-spent bars beside a ranked share list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IngTian/daylogs/main/assets/money.png)

Ranked bars rather than pie charts, deliberately: a terminal has about eight
distinguishable fill glyphs and there are nine categories, so a pie collides — and
you still need a legend to read any amount.

Shares are of **gross** spend. A refund can push a category below zero for the
window — a reimbursed bill, a returned order — and such a row keeps its amount but
shows no share, because a part-to-whole has no negative slice. It still appears on
both panels, so the rows and the header total reconcile.

### Maintenance, not resting BMR

Mifflin-St Jeor gives **resting** expenditure — roughly what you'd burn asleep all
day. Netting calories against that calls a sedentary day a deficit it isn't, and
understates a hard one. So `net` is measured against **burn**: resting BMR times an
activity factor.

The factor comes from your **profile**, not from a daily entry. "Sat at a desk" is
true almost every day, and a field you have to retype daily is one you skip — which
leaves `net` on the wrong baseline. Set it once, with `h`:

| Level | × | An ordinary day of |
|---|---|---|
| `desk` | 1.2 | sitting — desk work, little walking |
| `light` | 1.375 | some walking, errands, light standing |
| `active` | 1.55 | on your feet most of the day |
| `heavy` | 1.725 | physical work |

These are the standard PAL multipliers, **re-described on purpose**. The textbook
labels bake habitual exercise into the band ("moderate: exercise 3–5 days a week"),
and using those as a baseline *while also* logging hard days would count the
exercise twice. A level here means a day with nothing logged, so the wording
describes occupational movement only. Expect a different answer from an online TDEE
calculator; double counting is the worse error.

Nothing is assumed if you leave it out. With no level there is no factor, and every
calorie figure sits against resting BMR exactly as it did before — silently
defaulting to `desk` would raise your maintenance by 20% and restate every number on
screen and in every summary already written.

The ENERGY panel keeps the multiplier and where it came from on screen:

```
  in          1,200 kcal
  BMR         1,780
  activity     ×1.2  profile
  burn     −  2,136
            ─────────
  net          -936
```

A factor rescales every calorie judgement for its day, so it says whether it came
from your `profile` or was `logged`, rather than arriving as a number with nothing
to make you doubt it. The window average underneath is computed **per day** against
that day's own burn, so one hard day can't restate a whole month.

### Days that depart from the ordinary one

`a` logs an activity — and only then. An ordinary day needs no entry at all, which is
the entire reason the baseline lives in the profile.

`gym 1h =active` states the day's level outright and writes immediately. Omit the `=`
and Claude is asked instead, given your ordinary day *and everything already logged
for that day* — "a desk job at ×1.2, and today they also did gym 1h and a long walk"
is a far better-posed question than "estimate a multiplier". The answer arrives in a
review line you can correct before it lands, and is clamped to 1.2–1.9.

What is stored is the **whole day's** multiplier, not the session's own contribution:
a PAL describes a day and is not additive, so `gym` plus `walked` is not 1.375 + 1.2.
Log again and the newer row wins, the same last-reading-wins rule two weigh-ins on one
day follow — so correcting a day means logging it again, and the earlier rows stay as a
record of what was believed when.

If the estimate fails — no CLI, a timeout — the activity is still recorded, with no
factor, and the day falls back to your ordinary-day level. What you did is your data;
the multiplier is a guess, and losing the first because the second failed would be the
worse outcome.

`tab` reaches the **activity** view, where the day's rows are listed with their
factors, `enter` edits one and `x` deletes it. A row whose estimate never landed shows
a `—`.

**BMI** shows as a bare number beside your weight. No band, no colour and no chart:
"overweight" is a judgement daylogs doesn't make, and a BMI chart would be the
weight curve times a constant.

### The chart

A braille line chart: 2×4 dots per cell, so an 8-row by 48-column chart carries
96×32 dot resolution. The width follows the panel, so a wider terminal buys more
horizontal detail.

`c` cycles which series it plots — **weight**, **intake**, **net** — over whatever
window `+` / `-` have set. The panel names all three and marks the one you're on, and
the two controls are independent: zooming doesn't reset the series.

`net` is intake against **each day's own burn**, so one hard day moves only its own
point. It's a signed series, so zero has to be visible or a deficit and a surplus draw
the same line — an all-deficit month puts `0` at the ceiling, an all-surplus one at the
floor, and a month that crosses zero gets a `┼` on the axis at exactly that row.

`intake` is anchored at zero, because calories are a magnitude: fitted to its own
minimum, a run of similar days would read as a climb from nothing. Weight still fits
its own range, for the opposite reason —

Points sit at their real dates, not spread evenly across the panel. Two weigh-ins a
day apart show up as two weigh-ins a day apart, with the weeks you didn't step on
the scale visibly empty — a gap is information.

it sits in a narrow band, and anchored at zero a 70–75 kg series is a flat line at the
top of the panel.

It's a line rather than bars deliberately. A bar or filled area implies a meaningful
zero baseline; anchored at your minimum weight it would render as a solid block whose
only readable feature is its top edge. Spend is a magnitude from zero, so bars stay
correct there.

Days with nothing logged are absent from the calorie series rather than plotted as
zero — a logging gap is not a fast. `net` also skips days with no weigh-in behind
them, because there is no BMR to scale and showing the intake bare would read as an
enormous surplus.

### The daily summary

One `claude -p` call, once a day, over whatever the other two tabs recorded. It
runs unattended the first time you open the app after `summary_after_hour`, and `r`
regenerates it.

A report is dated by the day it *describes*, not the day it runs — a summary of
today would be reading a half-finished day, so the target is yesterday.

Anything you put in `memory.md` (see Configuration) is passed along as context for
who you are, so the summary can be about you rather than about a table of numbers.

### Any entry prompt

In the weigh / food / expense prompts, `@2026-08-25` or `@08-25` sets the date
and `@13:05` sets the time, wherever you put them in the line.

Everywhere: `esc` cancels, `↑` / `↓` walk that prompt's history.

## Configuration

Optional. `~/Documents/daylogs/config.toml`; every key has a default.

```toml
timezone             = "America/Toronto"
height_cm            = 170          # BMR input, and BMI
sex                  = "female"     # BMR constant term only
birthday             = "1990-01-01" # age, for BMR
activity             = "desk"       # ordinary day: desk/light/active/heavy
claude_model         = ""           # empty = CLI default
theme                = "gruvbox"    # any Textual theme; `T` sets it for you
summary_after_hour   = 6
summary_timeout_sec  = 120
estimate_timeout_sec = 60

# Paths. Relative values resolve against the data root above.
db_path              = "daylogs.db"
inbox_dir            = "inbox"      # phone photos land here
memory_path          = "memory.md"  # free text passed to the daily summary

[[category]]
slug    = "gym"
display = "Gym"
color   = "#9ba068"
```

Built-in categories: `grocery`, `restaurant`, `transport`, `housing`,
`utilities`, `subscriptions`, `entertainment`, `education`, `other`. Adding
one needs no code change — just a `[[category]]` block.

Height, sex and birthday feed the Mifflin-St Jeor BMR line, and height also gives
BMI. Leave them out and the Body tab shows calories with no baseline at all.
`activity` turns that resting number into maintenance — see [Maintenance, not
resting BMR](#maintenance-not-resting-bmr) — and is deliberately not defaulted.
You don't have to edit the file for any of the four: `h` on the Body tab writes them
here for you, keeping your comments and `[[category]]` blocks intact.

## Photos from a phone

Three ways in, tried in that order when you press `p`:

1. **Clipboard** — screenshot or Continuity Camera, then `p`.
2. **Inbox** — on the phone: Photos → Share → Save to Files →
   `daylogs/inbox`. The Body tab shows a pending count; `p` takes the oldest
   and moves it to `inbox/processed/` once the row is written. Shoot at lunch,
   log at night.
3. **Path** — paste or drag a file into the prompt.

A failed estimate leaves the file pending rather than silently consuming it.

## Data

SQLite, six tables, at `~/Documents/daylogs/daylogs.db`. Logs at
`~/.daylogs/logs/`. Override the data root with `DAYLOGS_HOME`.

This project was called **daybook** until 0.2.0, and the data root moved with the
rename. If a `~/Documents/daybook/` is still there, `day` refuses to start and
prints the two `mv` commands that move it — rather than quietly opening a new,
empty database beside your old one.

The connection runs `PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE` on purpose. WAL's `-wal` and
`-shm` sidecars can sync independently of the main file under iCloud Drive and
corrupt the database on the receiving device; rollback-journal keeps SQLite to
one file. daylogs is read-heavy, so the write cost is noise.

**Back it up.** A synced folder is not a backup: it replicates a deletion or a
corruption as faithfully as it replicates a write. `day backup <dir>` writes a
consistent copy via `VACUUM INTO`; point it somewhere else you own and run it
from cron.

**And get it out.** A backup only daylogs can open is a weaker promise than a file
anything can read, so `day export <dir>` writes one CSV per table into a dated
subdirectory — `weight`, `food`, `expense`, `recurring`, `budget`, `report`, with
the schema's own column names as headers. The table list comes from the database
rather than a hand-kept list, so nothing is silently left out. It prints the
directory on stdout and per-table row counts on stderr, so `cd "$(day export
~/Drive/daylogs)"` works and cron logs stay readable.

CSV, because every table is flat and "open it in a spreadsheet" is the point. The
one cost: CSV cannot tell an empty note from an absent one — both come out blank.
It is an export, not an import; loading it back in is not supported.

## Development

Working on daylogs wants an editable install with the dev extras, which is a
different thing from the isolated tool install above. Any environment manager
does; this is conda because that's what I use:

```bash
conda create -n daylogs python=3.12
conda activate daylogs
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

```bash
pytest
ruff check .
```

Runtime dependency: `textual`. Everything else is the standard library.

The README's three screenshots are generated, not drawn:

```bash
python tools/screenshots.py       # rewrites assets/{day,body,money}.{svg,png}
```

Run it after anything that moves the layout and commit the result. The seed data
is synthetic and the clock is pinned, so two runs produce byte-identical files —
a diff means the UI actually changed. The previous hand-drawn ASCII had drifted
out of alignment and had once advertised a key that was never bound; an
illustration nobody can verify against the app is an illustration that lies
eventually.

Design notes:

- Business logic never lives in `daylogs/tui/`. Tabs render and handle keys;
  arithmetic lives in `body.py` / `money.py` / `summary.py` with tests.
- The `claude -p` runners are always injected, so no test spawns a subprocess.
- Parsers in `parse.py` are pure functions with `now` passed in — no test
  depends on when it runs.
- Deletes are hard, with a session-scoped undo ring. That drops a `deleted_at`
  column from every table, the active/in-use query wrappers, a trash service,
  and a partial unique index.
