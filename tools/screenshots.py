"""Render the README's three screenshots from a live app.

    python tools/screenshots.py

Writes `assets/{day,body,money}.png`. Run it after any change that moves the
layout, and commit what it produces.

The README used to carry hand-drawn ASCII of the Day tab. It drifted twice: the
box borders fell out of alignment because `▼` and `🐄` are double-width and the
padding was counted in characters, and an earlier version advertised a key that
was never bound. Both are the same bug — an illustration maintained by hand
cannot be verified against the thing it illustrates. Rendering from the real app
makes that class of error impossible.

Everything here is synthetic and deliberately round. This repo is public, and a
screenshot is the one artifact where real numbers would be published verbatim.

Output is deterministic: the clock is pinned, and `report.generated_at` is
overwritten with a fixed stamp because `upsert_report` stamps `time.time()` and
takes no injection point. Two consecutive runs produce identical files, so a
regeneration that shows a diff means the UI actually changed.
